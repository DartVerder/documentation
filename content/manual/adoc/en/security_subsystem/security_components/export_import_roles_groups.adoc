==== Export and Import Roles and Access Groups

The *Roles* and *Access Groups* screens have actions for exporting the selected roles/access groups as ZIP or JSON and importing roles/access groups to the system (using the *Export*/*Import* buttons).

[TIP]
====
Export and import is only possible for roles and access groups defined at run time.
