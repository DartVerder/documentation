===== Creating a Custom Theme

You can create one or several application themes in the project and give the users an opportunity to select the most appropriate one. Creating new themes also allows you to override the variables in the `++*-theme.properties files++`, which define a few server-side parameters:

* Default dialog window size.

* Default input field width.

* Dimensions of some components (<<gui_Filter,Filter>>, <<gui_FileMultiUploadField,FileMultiUploadField>>).

* Correspondence between icon names and constants of the `com.vaadin.server.FontAwesome` enumeration for using *Font Awesome* in standard actions and screens of the platform, if <<cuba.web.useFontIcons,cuba.web.useFontIcons>> is enabled.

New themes can be easily created in CUBA Studio, in https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/cuba-cli[CUBA CLI] or manually. Let's consider all the three ways taking <<custom_theme_hover_dark,Hover Dark>> custom theme as an example.

In CUBA Studio: ::
+
--
* In the main menu, click *CUBA > Advanced > Manage themes > Create custom theme*. Enter the name of the new theme: *hover-dark*. Select the *hover* theme in the *Base theme* dropdown.
+
The required file structure will be created in the *web* module. The `webThemesModule` module and its configuration will be automatically added to the `settings.gradle` and <<build.gradle,build.gradle>> files. Also, the generated `deployThemes` gradle task allows you to see the changes without server restart.
--

Manually: ::
+
--
* Create the following file structure in the *web* module of your project:
+
[source, plain]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_44.scss[]
----

* The `app-component.scss` file:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_46.scss[]
----

* The `hover-dark.scss` file:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_47.scss[]
----

* The `styles.scss` file:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_48.scss[]
----

* Create the `hover-dark-theme.properties` file in the *web* subdirectory of your *web* module:
+
[source, plain]
----
@include=com/haulmont/cuba/hover-theme.properties
----

* Add the `webThemesModule` module to the `settings.gradle` file:
+
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_50.groovy[]
----

* Add the `webThemesModule` module configuration to the <<build.gradle,build.gradle>> file:
+
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_49.groovy[]
----

* Finally, create the `deployThemes` gradle task in `build.gradle` to see the changes without server restart:
+
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_51.groovy[]
----
--

In https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/cuba-cli[CUBA CLI]: ::
+
--
* Run the `theme` command, then select the *hover* theme.
+
The specific file structure will be created in the *web* module of the project.

* Modify the generated file structure and the files' contents so that they correspond to the files from above.

* Create the `hover-dark-theme.properties` file in the source directory of your *web* module:
+
[source, plain]
----
@include=com/haulmont/cuba/hover-theme.properties
----

The `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle` files will be updated automatically by CLI.

See also the example in <<custom_theme_facebook,>> section.

Modifying server-side theme parameters::
+
--
In Halo theme, *Font Awesome* icons are used for standard actions and platform screens by default (if <<cuba.web.useFontIcons,cuba.web.useFontIcons>> is enabled). In this case, you can replace a standard icon by setting the required mapping between the icon and the font element name in `<your_theme>-theme.properties` file. For example, to use "plus" icon for the `create` action in the new Facebook theme, the `facebook-theme.properties` file should contain the following:

[source, properties]
----
@include=com/haulmont/cuba/halo-theme.properties

cuba.web.icons.create.png = font-icon:PLUS
----

The fragment of the standard users browser screen in the Facebook theme with the modified `create` action:
