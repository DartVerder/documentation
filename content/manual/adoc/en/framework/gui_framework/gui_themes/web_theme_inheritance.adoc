===== Using Themes from Application Components

If your project contains an <<app_components,application component>> with a custom theme, you can use this theme for the whole project.

To inherit the theme as is, simply add it to the <<cuba.themeConfig,cuba.themeConfig>> application property:

[source, plain]
----
cuba.web.theme = {theme-name}
cuba.themeConfig = com/haulmont/cuba/hover-theme.properties /com/company/{app-component-name}/web/{theme-name}-theme.properties
----

In case you want to override some variables from the parent theme, you need to create a theme extension in your project first.

In the following example we will use the `facebook` theme from the <<web_theme_creation>> section.

. Follow the steps to create the `facebook` theme for your app component.

. Install the app component using Studio menu as described in the <<app_components_sample>> section.

. Extend the `halo` theme in the project that uses your application component.

. By means of your IDE, rename all `halo` occurrences in `themes` directory, including file names, to `facebook` in order to get the following structure:
+
[source, plain]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_28.scss[]
----

. The `app-component.scss` file aggregates theme modifications of the application component. During the SCSS build process, the Gradle plugin automatically finds the app components and imports them in the generated `modules/web/build/themes-tmp/VAADIN/themes/{theme-name}/app-components.scss` file.
+
By default `app-component.scss` does not include variables modifications from `{theme-name}-ext-defaults`. To include variables modifications to app component bundle, you should import it manually in `app-component.scss`:
+
[source, css]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_29.scss[]
----
+
At this stage the `facebook` theme is already imported from the app component to the project.

. Now you can use `facebook-ext.scss` and `facebook-ext-defaults.scss` files inside the `com.company.application` package to override variables from app component's theme and customize it for the concrete project.

. Add the following properties to the `web-app.properties` file to make the `facebook` theme available in the *Settings* menu of the application. Use the relative path to reference `facebook-theme.properties` from the app component.
+
[source, plain]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/themes/themes_30.scss[]
----

[TIP]
====
In case of any trouble with themes building check `modules/web/build/themes-tmp` directory. It contains all the files and generated `app-component.scss` includes, thus enabling you to investigate SCSS compilation problems.
