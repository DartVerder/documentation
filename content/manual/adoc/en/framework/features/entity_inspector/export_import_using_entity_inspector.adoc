===== Export and Import Using the Entity Inspector

Using the Entity Inspector, you can export and import any of the simple entities, including the system entities(for example, <<scheduled_tasks_cuba,scheduled tasks>>, <<pessimistic_locking,locks>>).

After selecting the entity type, the Entity Inspector screen displays actions for exporting the selected entity instances as ZIP or JSON and importing them to the system (using the *Export*/*Import* buttons).

[TIP]
====
Keep in mind that when an entity is exported using the Entity Inspector, reference attributes with the one-to-many or many-to-many relationship type cannot be exported. Import and export using the Entity Inspector work for simple cases, but if you need to export complex object graphs, youâ€™ll have to do in your application using the <<entityImportExport,EntityImportExportService>>.
