===== Uploading Files

Files from the user's computer can be uploaded into the storage using the <<gui_FileUploadField,FileUpload>> and <<gui_FileMultiUploadField,FileMultiUpload>> components. Usage examples are provided in this manual in the appropriate component descriptions.

See https://www.cuba-platform.com/guides/working-with-images[Working with Images in CUBA applications] guide to learn how to upload and display images in the application.

`FileUpload` component is also available within the ready-to-use `FileUploadDialog` window designed to load files in the temporary storage.

The `FileUploadDialog` window provides the base functionality for loading files into the temporary storage. It contains the drop zone for drag-and-dropping files from outside of the browser and the upload button.

The dialog is implemented with the legacy screen API and can be used as follows:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/features/fileUploadDialog_1.java[]
----
<1> - obtaining the `java.io.File` object which points to the file in the file system of the Web Client block. You may need it if you want to process the file somehow instead of just putting it into the <<file_storage,file storage>>.
<2> - creating a `FileDescriptor` entity.
<3> - uploading file to the file storage of the middle tier.
<4> - saving the `FileDescriptor` entity.

After a successful upload, the dialog is closed with `COMMIT_ACTION_ID`. In a `CloseWithCommitListener`, use the `getFileId()` and `getFileName()` methods to get the UUID and the name of uploaded file. Then you can get the file itself or create a `FileDescriptor` and upload the file to the file storage, or implement any other logic.

The temporary client-level storage (`FileUploadingAPI`) stores temporary files in the folder defined by <<cuba.tempDir,cuba.tempDir>> application property. Temporary files are deleted automatically in the following cases:

* If `FileUploadField` is used in `IMMEDIATE` <<gui_FileUploadField_fileStoragePutMode,mode>>.
* If you use the `FileUploadingAPI.putFileIntoStorage(UUID, FileDescriptor)` method.

Otherwise, you should delete the temporary files using the `FileUploadingAPI.deleteFile(UUID)` method.

Temporary files can remain in the folder in case of any failures. The `clearTempDirectory()` method of the `cuba_FileUploading` bean is invoked periodically by the scheduler defined in the <<spring.xml,cuba-web-spring.xml>> file. By default it runs on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday midnight and deletes all files older than 2 days.
