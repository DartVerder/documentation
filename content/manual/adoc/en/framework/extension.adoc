=== Functionality Extension

The platform enables extending and overriding the following aspects of its functionality in applications:

* Extending entity attributes set.

* Extending screens functionality. 

* Extending and overriding business logic contained in *Spring* beans.

Below is an example of the first two operations, illustrated by adding the "Address" field to the `User` entity of the platform <<users,security subsystem>>.
