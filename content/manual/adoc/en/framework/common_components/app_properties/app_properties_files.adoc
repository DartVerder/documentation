[[app_properties_files]]
===== Storing Properties in Files

Properties that determine configuration and deployment parameters are specified in special property files named according to the `++*app.properties++` pattern. Each application <<app_tiers,block>> contains a set of such files which is defined in the `appPropertiesConfig` parameter of <<web.xml,web.xml>>.

For example, the set of property files of the Middleware block is specified in the `web/WEB-INF/web.xml` file of the *core* module and looks as follows:

[source, xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>appPropertiesConfig</param-name>
    <param-value>
        classpath:com/company/sample/app.properties
        /WEB-INF/local.app.properties
        "file:${catalina.base}/conf/app-core/local.app.properties"
    </param-value>
</context-param>
----

The `classpath:` prefix means that the corresponding file can be found in the Java classpath, while `file:` prefix means that it should be loaded from the file system. A path without such prefix means the path inside the web application relative to its root. Java system properties can be used: in this example, `catalina.base` is the Tomcat installation path.

An order in which files are declared is important because the values, specified in each subsequent file override the values of the properties with the same name, specified in the preceding files.

The last file in the above set is `local.app.properties`. It can be used to override application properties upon deployment. If the file does not exist, it is silently ignored. You can create this file on the application server and define all properties specific to the environment in it. As a result, the settings will be separated from the application, and you will be able to update the application without fear of losing the specific configuration information. The <<tomcat_in_prod>> section contains an example of using the `local.app.properties` file.

[TIP]
====
Use the following rules when create `*.properties` files:

* File encoding â€“ `UTF-8`.

* The key can contain Latin letters, numbers, periods and underscores.

* The value is entered after (`=`) sign.

* Do not quote values using " or ' brackets.

* Set file paths either in UNIX (`/opt/haulmont/`) or Windows (`c:\\haulmont\\`) format.

* You can use `\n \t \r` codes. The `\` sign is a reserved code, use `\\` to insert it in a value. See more at: link:$$http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html$$[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html].

* To enter a multi-line value, use `\` sign at the end of each line .
