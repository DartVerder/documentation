====== Handling Unique Constraint Violation Exceptions

The framework allows you to customize the message displayed by an <<exceptionHandlers, exception handler>> for a database constraint violation error.

A custom message should be specified in the main message pack of the `web` module with a key equal to the database unique index name in uppercase. For example:

[source, properties]
----
IDX_SEC_USER_UNIQ_LOGIN = A user with the same login already exists
----

So, for example, if you got this notification:

image::unique_constraint_message.png[align="center"]

then by adding

[source, properties]
----
IDX_DEMO_PRODUCT_UNIQ_NAME = A product with this name already exists
----

to the main message pack, you will get the following notification:

image::unique_constraint_message_2.png[align="center"]

Detection of database constraint violation errors is done by the `UniqueConstraintViolationHandler` class which uses regular expressions depending on your database type. If the default expression doesn't recognize errors from your database, try to adjust it using the <<cuba.uniqueConstraintViolationPattern,cuba.uniqueConstraintViolationPattern>> application property.

You can also completely replace the standard handler by providing your own exception handler with a higher precedence, e.g. `@Order(HIGHEST_PLATFORM_PRECEDENCE - 10)`.
