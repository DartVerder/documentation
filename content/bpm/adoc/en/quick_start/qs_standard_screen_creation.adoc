=== Creating Standard Screens

Now we will create screens for contracts.

. Select the `Contract` entity in the *Data Model* section of the CUBA project tree and select *New > Screen* in the context menu  to create standard screens for viewing and editing `Contract` instances. After that, the template browser page will appear.

. Select *Entity browser and editor screens* in the list of available templates and click *Next*.

. All fields in this dialog are already populated with default values, there is no need to change them. Click *Next* and then *Finish*.

. The screen files will appear in the *Screens* section of the *Generic UI* tree section:

* `contract-browse.xml` – browser screen descriptor;

* `ContractBrowse` – browser screen controller;

* `contract-edit.xml` – editor screen descriptor;

* `ContractEdit` – editor screen controller.
